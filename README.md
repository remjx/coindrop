# Coindrop 💰

Create a simple webpage for accepting payments & donations. Open-source, zero-fee, and free forever.

## Problem ❓

Senders and receivers of money need to agree on medium of exchange. With so many apps and cryptocurrencies available to perform this service, it is not trivial to find the best payment method to use.

Often, receivers will request a specific form of payment, but the potential sender does not have access to this form of payment, or it is not convenient for them. This causes unnecessary friction and potential abandonment of the transaction.

## Solution ✔️

Receivers create a Coindrop address e.g. [coindrop\.to/satoshi](https://coindrop.to/satoshi) and list all their accepted forms of payment. They publish/send the link as a substitute any time they would normally publish/send payment address(es) individually. The sender then chooses which to use according to their preference (typically in order to maximize convenience and minimize transaction fees).

### When/where to use it? 🕒

* Does someone owe you money? ✔️ Send them your Coindrop link
* Would you like to accept donations? ✔️ Create a Coindrop for your brand and share it on your website or social media profile
* Do you provide services to customers in the real world and want to receive tips? ✔️ Add your Coindrop link to your business card

## Principles 🙏🏻

The Coindrop project is built according to the following principles:

### Open-source 👀

This software is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE).

This brings many benefits to the user:

* **Security**. Confidence that account information and payment addresses are not being tampered with since the source code is public and auditable. This application is deployed to https://coindrop.to and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
* **New Features**. Ideas for new features can be voted on and developed by community members. Users can even deploy their own version of Coindrop if they want to make custom enhancements.
* **Future-Proof**. You will be able to export your piggybank data if you ever decide to switch to another app to host your piggybank pages.

### Support for all payment methods 🌎

Virtually any payment method with an address can be listed on your piggybank page. Coindrop will never delist a payment method unless it is:
* Against the law
* Unsafe or insecure
