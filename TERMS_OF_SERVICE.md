# Terms of Service

By using this software, you agree to the following terms:

## No name squatting or deceitful Coindrop pages

We define name squatting or deceit as taking namespace with no intention of using it to accept payments for yourself or an entity you legally represent. For example, creating https://coindrop.to/Michael-Jackson if that is not your name, or creating https://coindrop.to/Coca-Cola if you do not have permission from the Coca Cola Company, is not permitted.

If a potential violation is detected, we will contact you via e-mail to verify your identity, request deletion, or notify you of deletion. Coindrop reserves the right to remove any Coindrop pages from your account ownership, but our intention is clear: to only remove those which are deceitful.

## User generated content

Coindrop is only to be used by users to:
1) Identify themselves or the party/organization they are creating a page on behalf of (name, website)
2) Provide identifying and payment information for the person/party above
3) Customize user interface e.g. page themes and preferences

Submission of any other information is not permitted and may result in suspension of your account or page.

## Public availability of information

By using this service, you acknowledge that any information entered on a Coindrop page is publicly accessible.

## Changes To This Document

These terms of service are effective immediately and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

Coindrop reserves the right to update this document at any time. If any material changes to this document are made, users will be notified via e-mail.
