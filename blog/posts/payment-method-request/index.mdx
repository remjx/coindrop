You're almost finished setting up your Coindrop. You're on the last step: setting your payment methods - but oh, no! One of your payment methods is not in the list of available options.

Do not worry. This article explains how to request your payment method be added to the list.

It is super quick for us to add it. We just require a manual verification. And we'll add the icon to make it appear nice and pretty on your Coindrop page.

## Option 1) Open a Github issue

This is preferred if you already have a Github account or don't mind creating one. Simply fill out [this Github template](https://github.com/remjx/coindrop/issues/new?assignees=markjackson02&labels=enhancement&template=new_payment_method.md&title=).

## Option 2) Send us an e-mail

Send an e-mail to [coindrop.to@gmail.com](mailto:coindrop.to@gmail.com) with the following information:
- Payment method name
- Payment method website

## We'll let you know once it's added

Once you've completed Option 1 or 2, you will be notified once the payment method has been added. You'll then be able to finalize the setup of your Coindrop.

Thank you for your patience!
