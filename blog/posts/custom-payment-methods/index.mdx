Currently, to add a new payment method to Coindrop, you must submit a [request](https://coindrop.to/blog/payment-method-request) to add it to the registry.

Soon, you will be able to add your own custom payment method even if it doesn't exist in the registry. We will send out an e-mail to newsletter subscribers when this feature is available.
